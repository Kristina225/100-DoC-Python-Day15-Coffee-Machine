## Overview

### The challenge

A solution to day 15 of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp" course.
The challenge was to create a coffee machine maker.
The coffee machine has a set number of resources to make the coffee.
Before each use, the machine checks to see if it has the resources available to make the drinks.
The user is then asked to pick a drink, and enter the coins necessary to pay for that drink.
If the user doesn't enter enough coins, the machine asks the user to either enter the remaining amount, 
or to cancel the order and get a refund.
Otherwise, the drink is served, and the machine restarts.


## My process

### Built with

- Python

### Continued development

I need more practice in procedural programming, and I need to start getting comfortable with OOP.
